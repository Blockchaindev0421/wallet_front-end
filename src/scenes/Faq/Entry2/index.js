    Our Security Center can help you keep your wallet secure and ensure that you can access your
    funds even if you lose your password - all in less than 5 minutes.
    A great place to start is to enable 2-Step Verification to help prevent unauthorized access to your wallet
    and write down your Recovery Phrase to make sure you never lose access to your funds.
    We also recommend using a unique, random password thatâ€™s at least 16 characters or more.
